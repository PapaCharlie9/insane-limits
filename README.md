Description  
-------------

This plugin is a customizable limits/rules enforcer. It allows you to setup and enforce limits based on player statistics, and server state.   
  
It tracks extensive Battlelog stats, and round stats. If you feel that there is a stat, or aggregate, or information that really needs to be included, post feedback on the PRoCon forums. The plugin supports events like OnKill, OnTeamKill, OnJoin, OnSpawn, etc. You are able to perform actions triggered by those events.  
  
For a full list of examples, jump to the index in the <a href="http://www.phogue.net/forumvb/showthread.php?3448-Insane-Limits-Examples" >Insane Limits - Examples thread.</a>  
  
By default, the plugin ships with **virtual_mode** set to _True_. This allows you to test your limits/rules without any risk of accidentally kicking or banning anyone. Once you feel your limits/rules are ready, you can disable **virtual_mode**.

Disclaimer  
-------------

If you are careless with the rules, sometimes you can end up hurting more than helping. Having said that, it's not up to me or anyone to judge the merit of a limit/rule, otherwise this can become a flame war. Be polite when replying to posts, and don't flame others because you don't like their rules. I just give you the tool, and you (the server admin) make the rules.  
  
My advise is, think creatively when coming up with the rules, and be open minded. If you do not know how to express your limit ideas in C#, ask the PRoCon forums. The data is there, available, ready to be consumed ... you just have to come up with the ideas.

> Note that limit evaluation is only performed after the plugin has fetched the player stats from Battlelog.   
  
When you enable the plugin for the first time in a full server, it will take a couple of minutes to fetch all player stats  
  
Architecture  
-------------
  
When the plugin is enabled, it starts two threads:   
  
The **fetch** thread is in charge of monitoring the players that join the server. It fetches player statistics from battlelog.battlefield.com  
  
The **enforcer** thread is in charge of evaluating Interval limits. When the **enforcer** thread finds that a player violates a limit, it performs an action (Kick, Ban, etc) against that player.  
  
The two threads have different responsibilities, but they synchronize their work.   
  
  
Fetch-thread Flow  
-------------
  
When players join the server, they are added the stats queue. The fetch thread is constantly monitoring this queue. If there is a player in the queue, it removes him from the queue, and fetches the battlelog stats for the player.  
  
The stats queue can grow or shrink depending on how fast players join, and how long the web-requests take. If you enable the plugin on a full server, you will see that almost immediately all players are queued for stats fetching. Once the stats are fetched for all players in the queue, they are added to the internal player's list.  
  
  
Enforcer-thread Flow  
-------------

The enforcer thread runs on a timer (every second). It checks if there are any interval limits ready to be executed. If there are, it will evaluate those limits.  
  
Each time around that the **enforcer** checks for the available limits is called an _iteration_. If there are no players in the server, or there are no limits available, the **enforcer** skips the current _iteration_ and sleeps until the next _iteration_.  
  
The enforcer is only responsible for Limits that evaluate OnIterval, events. Enforcing for other types of events like OnKill, and OnSpawn, is done in the main thread when procon sends the event information.   
  
  
Limit Management  
-------------
  
**Creation** - In order to create a new limit, you have to set **new_limit** variable to **True**.  
  
> This creates a new limit section with default values that you can change.  
  
  
**Deletion** - In order to delete a limit, you have to set the variable **delete_limit** to the numerical _id_ of the limit you want to delete.  
  
> Each limit has an **id** number, you can see the **id** number in the limit name, e.g. Limit #**5**.  
  
Limit Definition  
-------------
  
At its basic, there are four fields that determine the structure of a limit. These fields are **state**, **action**, and **first_check**, and **second_check**.  
  
**state**  
* _Enabled_- the limit will be used by the plugin thread   
* _Disabled_ - the limit will be ignored by the plugin thread  
* _Virtual_ - the limit will be used, but actions will be done in **virtual_mode**  
  
This field is useful if you want to temporarily disable a limit from being used, but still want to preserve its definition.  
  
**action**  
* _(string, psv)_ - list of actions for this limit (Pipe separated ""|"")  
  
e.g. Say | PBBan | Mail   
  
These are all the allowed actions:  

* _None_ - no action is performed against the player
* _Kick_ - player is kicked, if the limit evaluates to _True_
* _EABan_ - player is banned (using the BF3 ban-list), if the limit evaluates _True_
* _PBBan_ - player is banned (using PunkBuster ban-list), if the limit evaluates _True_
* _Kill_ - kills the player (delay optional), if the limit evaluates _True_
* _Say_ - sends a message the server (All, Team, Squad, or Player), if the limit evaluates _True_
* _Log_- logs a message to a File, Plugin log, or both, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _Mail_ - sends an e-mail to specified address, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _SMS_ - sends an SMS message to the specified phone number, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _Tweet_ - posts a Twitter status update (default account is @InsaneLimits), if the limit evaluates _True_
* _PBCommand_ - executes the specified PunkBuster command, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _ServerCommand_ - executes the specified Server command, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _PRoConChat_ - sends the specified text to PRoCon's Chat-Tab, if the limit evaluates _True_
* _PRoConEvent_ - adds the specified event to PRoCon's Events-Tab, if the limit evaluates_True_
* _TaskbarNotify_ - sends a Windows Taskbar notification, if the limit evaluates _True_
  
Depending on the selected action, other fields are shown to specify more information about the action.  
  
> Supported PB ban-duration: _Permanent_, _Temporary_  
> Supported PB ban-type: _PB_GUID_ (default)  
  
> Supported EA ban-duration: _Permanent_, _Temporary_, _Round_  
> Supported EA ban-type: _EA_GUID_, _IPAddress_, _Name_  
  
Also note that each of these actions have a **target** player. You have to be careful on what **target** is for each action.  
  
For example, during a Kill event, the target of the action is the Killer. But, during a Death event, the target of the action is the player that was killed. You don't want to accidentally Kick/Ban the wrong player!  
  
* **first_check**
    * _Disabled_ - the limit does not evaluate anything in the first step of evaluation  
    * _Expression_ - the limit uses a C# conditional expression during the first step of evaluation  
    * _Code_ - the limit uses a C# code snippet (must return true/false) during the first step of evaluation  
  
* **second_check**  
    * _Disabled_ - the limit does not evaluate anything in the second step of evaluation  
    * _Expression_ - the limit uses a C# conditional expression during the second step of evaluation  
    * _Code_ - the limit uses a C# code snippet (must return true/false) during the second step of evaluation  
  
Depending on the selected check type, an extra field will be shown for specifying the _Expression_, or _Code_ text.  
Both _Expressions_, and _Code_ snippets must be syntactically correct in accordance to the C# language.The plugin compiles your _Expression_/_Code_ in-memory with the Microsoft C# Compiler. If there are compilation errors, those are shown in the plugin log.  
  
If you do not know what C# is, or what an expression is, or what a code snippet is ... do not worry. Study the examples in the <a href="http://www.phogue.net/forumvb/showthread.php?3448-Insane-Limits-Examples" >Insane Limits - Examples thread.</a>. Then, if you are still unclear, how to write an expression or a code snippet, ask for help in the PRoCon forums.  
  
Limit Evaluation  
-------------
  
After compilation, limit evaluation is by far the most important of all steps this plugin goes through.  
  
Limit evaluation is comprised of three steps:
  
1. **first_check** Evaluation

  During this step, the plugin executes the _Expression_/_Code_ in **first_check** to get a _True_ or _False_ result.  

  If the result is _False_ , the plugin does not perform any **action**, and quits. But, if it's _True_ , it keeps going to the next step   
  
2. **second_check** Evaluation (optional)
  
  Next, the plugin runs the _Expression_/_Code_ for the **second_check**, if it's enabled. If it's not enabled, it keeps going to next step.  
  
3. **action** Execution

  If the final result of the limit evaluation is _True_, the plugin then executes the **action** associated with the limit.  
  
  If the final result of the limit evaluation is _False_, no **action** is executed.  


Objects  
-------------

When writing a limit _Expression_ or _Code_ snippet, there are several globally defined objects that can be used. These are **server**, **player**, **killer**, **victim**, **kill**, **plugin**, **team1**, **team2**, **team3**, **team4**, and **limit**. These objects contain values, and functions that can be accessed from within the _Expressions_, or _Code_ snippets.  
  

Limit Object  
-------------
  
The **limit** object represents the state the limit that was just activated. This object is only available during the **second_check**. The **limit** object implements the following interface:  
  
~~~
public interface LimitInfoInterface
{
   //Number of times the limit has been activated, (Current round)
    double Activations(String PlayerName);
    double Activations(int TeamId, int SquadId);
    double Activations(int TeamId);

    // Number of times player has activated this limit (Current round) in the given TimeSpan, e.g. last 10 seconds, etc
    double Activations(String PlayerName, TimeSpan time);
    double Activations();


    //Number of times the limit has been activated (All rounds)
    double ActivationsTotal(String PlayerName);
    double ActivationsTotal(int TeamId, int SquadId);
    double ActivationsTotal(int TeamId);
    double ActivationsTotal();
   
    // Number of times this limit has been activated by player
    /* 
     * Kill, TeamKill: Spree value is reset when player dies
     * Death, TeamDeath, and Suicide: Spree value is reset whe player makes a kill
     * 
     * Spawn, Join, Interval: Spree value is never reset, you may reset it manually.
     */
    
    double Spree(String PlayerName);

    // manually resets the Spree value for the player, (only for power-users)
    void ResetSpree(String PlayerName);
    
    /* Data Repository set/get custom data */

Simple (Traditional) Replacements  
-------------
  
This plugin supports an extensive list of message text replacements. A replacement is a string that starts and ends with the percent character %. When you use them in the text of a message, the plugin will try to replace it with the corresponding value. For example:   
  
The message
~~~
    %k_n% killed %v_n% with a %w_n%
~~~

becomes

~~~
    micovery killed NorthEye with a PP-2000
~~~

Below is the list of all supported simple replacements.

Advanced Replacements  
-------------

In addition to the simple %**key**% replacments, this plugin also allows you to use a more advanced type of replacement. Within strings, you can use replacements that match properties in known objects. For example, if you use **player.Name** within a string, the plugin will detect it and replace it appropriately.  
  
A common usage for advanced replacements is to list player stats in the Kick/Ban reason. For example:  
  
The message   
  
~~~
    player.Name you were banned for suspicious stats: Kpm: player.Kpm, Spm: player.Spm, Kdr: player.Kdr
~~~

becomes

~~~
    micovery you were banned for suspicious stats: Kpm: 0.4, Spm: 120, Kdr: 0.61
~~~

Settings  
-------------
  
0. **player_white_list**

  _false_ - limit **actions** (kick, ban) are not simulated
  
0. **console**

  _(string)_ - you can use this field to run plugin commands
  
> For example: !stats micovery will print the player statistic for the current round in the plugin console.
  
Note that plugin commands, are currently supported only inside ProCon, and not In-Game. 
  
0. **smtp_port**

  _(String)_ - Address of the SMTP Mail server used for _Mail_ action

0. **auto_hide_sections**

  _true_ - when creating a new section, it will be hidden by default  
  _false_ - when creating a new section, it will not be hidden

0. **twitter_verifier_pin**

  _(String)_ - this field is displayed for you to enter the Twitter verification PIN, it disappears as soon as you enter it
  
  > After entering your PIN, the plugin will try to exchange the PIN for a Twitter **access_token**, and **access_token_secret**. If the verifcation stage fails, you must re-initiate the Twitter setup process.   
  
  
Plugin Commands  
-------------
  
These are the commands supported by this plugin. You can run them from within the **console** field. Replies to the commands are printed in the plugin log.  
  
* 
  **!round stats**  
  Aggregate stats for all players, current round  
  
  **!total stats**  
  Aggregate stats for all players, all rounds  
  
  **!weapon round stats**  
  Weapon-Level aggregate stats for all players, current round  
  
  **!weapon total stats**  
  Weapon-Level aggregate stats for all players, all rounds  
  
  **!web stats {player}**  
  Battlelog stats for the current player  
  
  **!round stats {player}**  
  Aggregate stats for the current player, current round  
  
  **!total stats {player}**  
  Aggregate stats for the current player, all rounds  
  
  **!weapon round stats {player}**  
  Weapon-Level stats for the current player, current round  
  
  **!weapon total stats {player}**  
  Weapon-Level stats for the current player, all round  

  
  These are the most awesome of all the commands this plugin provides. Even if you are not using this plugin to enforce any limit, you could have it enabled for just monitoring player stats.  
  
  When calling player specific statistic commands, if you misspell, or only type part of the player name, the plugin will try to find the best match for the player name.  
  
* **!dump limit {id}**  
  
  This command creates a file in ProCon's directory containing the source-code for the limit with the specified _id_  
  
  For example, the following command   

  > !dump limit **5**  
  
  Creates the file LimitEvaluator**5**.cs inside ProCon's directory.   
  
  This command is very useful for debugging compilation errors, as you can see the code inside the file exactly as the plugin sees it (with the same line and column offsets).  
  
* 
  **!set {variable} {to|=} {value}**  
  **!set {variable} {value}**   
  **!set {variable}**  
  
  This command is used for setting the value of this plugin's variables.  
  For the last invocation syntax the value is assumed to be True.   
  
* **!get {variable} **  
  
  This command prints the value of the specified variable.  
  

In-Game Commands  
-------------
  
These are the In-Game commands supported by this plugin. You can run them only from within the game. Replies to the commands are printed in the game chat.  
  

* **!stats**  
  List the available stats, Battlelog  
  
* **!stats [web|battlelog]**  
  List the available stats, Battlelog  
  
* **!stats round**  
  List the available stats, current round  
  
* **!stats total**  
  List the available stats, all rounds  

These commands are used as a shortcut for players to view what type of stats they can query. The plugin will try to fit all stat types into a single chat message.  
  
* **!my {type}**  
  Print Battlelog stat of the specified **type** for the player that executed the command  
  
* **!my round {type}**  
  Print current round stat of the specified **type** for the player that executed the command  
  
* **!my total {type}**  
  Print all rounds stat of the specified **type** for the player that executed the command  
  
* **?{player} {type}**  
  Print Battlelog stat of the specified **type** for the specified **player**  
  
* **?{player} round {type}**  
  Print current round stat of the specified **type** for the specified **player**  
  
* **?{player} total {type}**  
  Print all rounds stat of the specified **type** for the specified **player**  
  
  The **player** name can be a sub-string, or even misspelled. The plugin will find the best match.  
  
  These are the allowed stat **types**:

  > **Battlelog**: kdr, kpm, time, kills, wins, skill, spm, score, deaths, losses, repairs, accuracy, quit pecent, team score, combat socre, objective score, vehicles killed, recon time, engineer time, assault time, support time, vehicle time, engineer percent, assault percent, vehicle percent 
  
  > **Round**: kdr, kpm, spm, score, kills, deaths, headshots, team kills, team deaths, suicides, time Total: kdr, kpm spm, socre, kills, deaths, headshots, team kills, team deaths, suicides, time, rounds
  
  Here are some example commands:  

~~~
    !my kdr  
    !my spm  
    !my engineer percent  
    !micovery recon time  
~~~

Beware this is not private ... anyone find out the default account password from the source code, and look at the mails that have been sent. You should change it to use your own Gmail account ... or use a different SMTP provider.
